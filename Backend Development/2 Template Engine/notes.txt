Template Engire....

A template engine enable yuou to use static template files in your application.

At runtime, the template engine replaces variables, in a atemplate file with actual values, and transform the template into an HTML file send to the client.

This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page..

Popular Temp Engine... Ejs, Pug, Mustache, Nunjucks, Dust etc..

Setup app for template engine...

npm install ejs
 - setup the directory where template file are located
   => app.set('views', './views') // by default it set, but if we change folder, so we need to mention where fie path.

 - for use => app.set('view engine', 'ejs')


- Whan you make a request to the home page, the index.ejs file will be rendered as HTML.. we use render() method;

res.render() - It renders a view and send the rendered HTML string to the client.
Syntax: re.render(view[, locals][, callback])
